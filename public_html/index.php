    <h1>Starcraft II Co-op Game Mode</h1>
    <p>Starcraft II is a real-time strategy game by Blizzard Entertainment. It is one of the most successful RTS's in history. In 2015, Starcraft II introduced a co-op mode, where two players would face up against Amon in a PVE-type mission. The game features several different commanders to play and many different maps to choose from.</p>
    <p>This site serves as a repository of all the information gathered by the Starcraft II co-op community. It aims to help players improve their gameplay, by providing in-depth commander and map analysis, as well as providing tips on how to deal with certain tricky situations that may arise in-game.</p>
    <p>Starcraft II is currently free to play. Three of the commanders in co-op mode are free, while the others are free to play up to level 5. If you are a new player, check out the <a href="/guides/newplayer">New Players</a> page to help you select your first commander. Also, check out the <a href="guides/generaltips">General Tips</a> page for some great tips to get you started with this game mode.</p>
