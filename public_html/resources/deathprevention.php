    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Death Prevention Effects are effects that stop a unit from dying. Examples of these are <a href="/commanders/artanis">Artanis' Guardian Shell</a> and <a href="/commanders/kerrigan">Kerrigan's Torrasque Strain Ultralisk Passive</a>. When multiple Death Prevention Effects are active, it is difficult to predict what order they will trigger. The order of Death Prevention Effects is shown in the following section.</p>
