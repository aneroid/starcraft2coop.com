    <h1>Game Spotlight</h1>
    <p>Game Spotlight is a special non-routine series of game casts from some of the best Co-op players in the community. The videos provide a glimpse of what Co-op looks like at the highest levels of play and show how top Co-op players handle difficult situations. Each game will be casted with added "Did You Know" facts scattered throughout the video. A full playlist is below:</p>

    <!--
    <p>If you have a game that displays a high level of skill, or one that features a very unusual strategy, then you are welcome to submit the replay for casting. Before submitting a replay, please consider the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Games should feature a good level of Co-op skill and understanding</li>
        <li>Games should feature mutators with a high level of total difficulty</li>
        <li>Games must ideally be played on Brutal difficulty. However, certain strategies may only work on easier levels, in which case, those difficulties may be submitted.</li>
        <li>Games do <i>NOT</i> need to show a victory, but the game must be fun to watch, and the victory should have been close</li>
        <li>Games can be solo runs as long as the ally's resources/expansions aren't being taken by the solo player</li>
        <li>Some examples of games that could get casted:
            <ul>
                <li>Games featuring a large number of mutators</li>
                <li>Games with a very difficult set of mutators that is not the current <a href="/resources/weeklymutations">Weekly Mutation</a>. Past mutations are fine.</li>
                <li>Games where players use a very inefficient/unfavourable strategy to complete the mission</li>
                <li>A game where victory was assured until the very last few moments</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Replays should not be too old (more than 2-3 years old) to ensure the Co-op Observer UI works well.</li>
    </ul>
