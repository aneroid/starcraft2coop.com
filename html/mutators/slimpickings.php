    <p>All mineral patches contain a maximum of 1500 minerals per patch. Automated refineries, assimilators, MULEs and workers will all harvest 1 resource per tick/trip.</p>
    <p>Resource pickups spawn every 5.4 seconds before the 3-minute mark, after which they will spawn every 7 seconds. Each pickup contains either 50 minerals or 50 gas. A spawn will either contain two mineral pickups, or 1 mineral pickup and 1 gas pickup. They can only be picked up by ground units.</p>
    <p>Every other spawn, a pickup will spawn anywhere on map, while the other will only spawn within 30 range of the starting location. This only occurs before the 3-minute mark, after which pickups will never be limited to spawning at the starting location.</p>
